static code analysis from scratch in which a user can input his code file written
in python, java, php, JavaScript etc and check for vulnerability threats in his
code, as security is a main concern nowadays. Through this website one can
know if his code is secure or not.

Summary
I'm a AI Engineer with extensive experience in utilizing advanced
querying, visualization, and analytics tools to analyze and process
complex data sets. I've built company A/B testing frameworks to test
model quality and developed intricate algorithms based on deep-
dive statistical analysis and predictive data modeling. My ability to
identify, measure, and recommend improvement strategies for KPIs
across business areas has been invaluable to my past organizations.
I've also created and implemented new forecasting models to
increase company productivity, compiled, cleaned, and manipulated
data for proper handling, tested and validated models for accuracy
of predictions in outcomes of interest, and modeled predictions with
Decision Tree classifier. Furthermore, I implemented randomized
sampling techniques for optimized surveys, integrated information
from multiple data sources, solved common transformation
problems, and resolved data cleansing and quality issues.
Before that, I worked as a data analyst and identified and
documented detailed business rules and use cases based on
requirements analysis, identified, analyzed, and interpreted trends
or patterns in complex data sets, and designed and implemented
tools to support strategic value chain optimization initiatives. I used
statistical methods to analyze data and generate useful business
reports, upheld security and confidentiality of documents and data
within the area of responsibility, and implemented code solutions
to answer analytic questions and test and assess new methods.
Additionally, I analyzed transactions to build logical business
intelligence model for real-time reporting needs and documented
effective and replicable methods for extracting data and organizing
data sources.

Overall, I'm passionate about the potential of Artificial intelligence
to solve real-world problems and look forward to taking on new
challenges in the field.
