Summary
I design critically important pixie dust to make an organization hum!
What does it mean? I work on the culture and people because thats
important for the success of any organization.
I believe in ABC (Always Be Cultivating) philosophy by thinking of
recruitment as a sales process. If you want A-players on your team,
your company must spend as much time and effort attracting and
retaining employees as it does on finding and keeping customers.
Talent Acquisition should be run like a marketing campaign for a
product. A candidate's entire journey from the time they see your
ad, until they join your company says a lot about the brand.Their exit
also matters so that they can keep continuing employer branding of
you.
I do not believe in yearly performance appraisal. It doesn't work!
What works is constant feedback, team building and focusing on
leadership skills. You see a problem and you work on it. Do not wait
for a year to appraise. I help build teams, strengthen coordination,
team work, cross functionality, process mapping. Everything got to
be practical and effective otherwise its of no use.
