Summary
I am an HR Generalist that thrives on helping others and going
above and beyond with each and every task. I’m passionate about
the people of organization because I believe that employees are the
engine of any businesses and it’s vital to create cultures in which
they can thrive.
With over 3 years of experience in HR, I am adept at enhancing the
employee experience and developing positive workplace cultures.
Also, I am a data-driven and an insightful recruiter who is passionate
about growing teams and dreams.
And when I am not recruiting or making excel sheets or developing
organizational culture, I am likely re-watching Breaking Bad or The
Office for the hundredth time, listening to Beyoncé songs or hanging
out with my friends.
