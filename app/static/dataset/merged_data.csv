Summary
I design critically important pixie dust to make an organization hum!
What does it mean? I work on the culture and people because thats
important for the success of any organization.
I believe in ABC (Always Be Cultivating) philosophy by thinking of
recruitment as a sales process. If you want A-players on your team,
your company must spend as much time and effort attracting and
retaining employees as it does on finding and keeping customers.
Talent Acquisition should be run like a marketing campaign for a
product. A candidate's entire journey from the time they see your
ad, until they join your company says a lot about the brand.Their exit
also matters so that they can keep continuing employer branding of
you.
I do not believe in yearly performance appraisal. It doesn't work!
What works is constant feedback, team building and focusing on
leadership skills. You see a problem and you work on it. Do not wait
for a year to appraise. I help build teams, strengthen coordination,
team work, cross functionality, process mapping. Everything got to
be practical and effective otherwise its of no use.

Summary
I'm a AI Engineer with extensive experience in utilizing advanced
querying, visualization, and analytics tools to analyze and process
complex data sets. I've built company A/B testing frameworks to test
model quality and developed intricate algorithms based on deep-
dive statistical analysis and predictive data modeling. My ability to
identify, measure, and recommend improvement strategies for KPIs
across business areas has been invaluable to my past organizations.
I've also created and implemented new forecasting models to
increase company productivity, compiled, cleaned, and manipulated
data for proper handling, tested and validated models for accuracy
of predictions in outcomes of interest, and modeled predictions with
Decision Tree classifier. Furthermore, I implemented randomized
sampling techniques for optimized surveys, integrated information
from multiple data sources, solved common transformation
problems, and resolved data cleansing and quality issues.
Before that, I worked as a data analyst and identified and
documented detailed business rules and use cases based on
requirements analysis, identified, analyzed, and interpreted trends
or patterns in complex data sets, and designed and implemented
tools to support strategic value chain optimization initiatives. I used
statistical methods to analyze data and generate useful business
reports, upheld security and confidentiality of documents and data
within the area of responsibility, and implemented code solutions
to answer analytic questions and test and assess new methods.
Additionally, I analyzed transactions to build logical business
intelligence model for real-time reporting needs and documented
effective and replicable methods for extracting data and organizing
data sources.

Overall, I'm passionate about the potential of Artificial intelligence
to solve real-world problems and look forward to taking on new
challenges in the field.

I volunteered to work at a non-formal school when the school's head
approached me after we met at a meeting at SAP-(AWAZ forum, a local
human rights activists' forum). I taught unprivileged kids from slums and got to
connect with some amazing kids who would collect garbage in the evenings
and study in the mornings; this experience gave me a new perspective on life.

system, whereas the mobile recommendation system is a collaborative filtering
  Page 1 of 3   
system that uses item-based, user-based, KNN, and SVD approaches. The
cosine similarity matrix is the distance measure used for forecasting top N
movies based on their description, while average rating technique is employed
to predict top N mobiles reviewed by users.
Project3: COVID-19 Detection in Chest X-rays
Description: The dataset was collected through Kaggle. It contains almost
30k images which are splitted by 70:30 into train and test data, respectively.
The preprocessing of the image is done by resizing to 240x240, normalization
and histogram equalization is performed. The model is developed to train the
data using Deep Learning approaches which are CNN along with pre-trained
models RESNET-50, and VGG-16. The test accuracy of CNN, RESNET-50
and VGG-16 was 86.75%, 82.75%, and 84.25%.
Project4: Twitter Followers and Tweets Extraction Through Web Scraping
Description: I signed onto Twitter, navigated to the followers page, retrieved
their general information, and saved it to.csv files. Following that, I automate
my way to the homepage timeline and extract the tweets, the information of
the person who tweets it, the amount of likes, comments, and shares the post
received, and ultimately it is saved to a.csv file.

Excelled in preparing and maintaining ETL pipelines, seamlessly integrating
data from diverse sources, including CSV, Excel, and Tabular formats. My
expertise ensured the efficient processing of data, making it ready for analysis
and reporting purposes. I took charge of the entire ETL process, collaborating
effectively with stakeholders to understand project requirements and delivering
exceptional results. My project management skills, coupled with technical
proficiency, enabled the successful execution of the MADELLIA project,
contributing to KYNDRYL's data-driven success.
On another project (BLUEID) challenge I encountered was loading a massive
table with billions of rows into the database, which had a strict 10-minute
threshold. To overcome this limitation, I implemented an innovative solution
using DataStage and shell scripting.
Used a looping mechanism in the DataStage with runtime query changes. By
dynamically changing the query through the shell script, I ensured that the job
fetched data in smaller chunks, organized by month. This approach prevented
the insert statements from reaching the database threshold and enabled the
successful loading of historical data.

The challenge with BLUEID (KYNDRYL's record directory system), was the
repetitive nature of frequently asked questions to the support team. To address
this, a chatbot was developed using PyTorch, employing an Encoder-Decoder
architecture. The chatbot successfully 
• Understood the  input of the client .
• And can generate the most relevant answer to his query. 
streamlining support operations and enhancing user experience.

The primary challenge was dealing with large table sizes, making it impractical
to load all the data at once. To address this, we devised an efficient strategy,
creating monthly or yearly CSV files based on data volume and loading them
into the DB2 warehouse. We utilized shell scripting and Teradata Parallel

Summary
An interest to comprehend how things work and the laws they follow
took me to pursue a career in physics, during my bachelors I came
across computer programming and was amazed by the technology
and the century of innovation that led us to the modern day picture of
automation, after I completed my bachelors in physics, I had to know
more about computers and so I did through online lectures, e-books,
lecture notes I took from my friends and before I knew it became a
passion and the excitement to run codes, understanding algorithms,
implementing them or just staring at the screen and being amazed
by all that was taking place inside a machine that only understood
binary language.
So, now if I got a chance to pursue a career in computer science, I'll
do it without a doubt and would love to embark on a journey that will
lead to a world running on algorithms.

Lead Machine Learning Engineer
November 2021 - Present  (2 years)
• Development of Geo‑Spatial Framework
Designed a geospatial framework in Python, in which we generalize common
operations like optimizing conversions between different CSRS, wrote custom
readers for different geo files, to introduce parallelism in processing geo data,
mapped sales data to maps to attach third-party attributes to sales entities
(products, customers, routes, areas) for introducing new dimensions to the
analysis.
• Predicting Stockouts and What Causing Them
An FMCG distributes tens of brands at thousands of shops in a single city. We
designed a system using processed sales data to predict shops getting out of
stock in combination with brands. We used our Statistical Sales Forecasting
engine to calculate the sellout rate of each brand at each
shop. Then designed a depletion strategy with a spilling mechanism to identify
the shops which will get out of stock in the future.
• Debugging Fluctuations in Sales
A system is programmed to find possible causes of sales fluctuations, e.g.,
sales of product X dropped in city Y. In this, we processed raw sales data
  Page 1 of 4   
using an internally crafted geospatial framework. Then we used this processed
data in a hierarchical way to find anomalies in different dimensions
E.g., sales fluctuation in time, in Socioeconomic classes (geo‑annotated), in
custom areas (provided by FMCG), or on the basis of other geo‑annotated
data available.
• Statistical Sales Forecasting
Sales are statistically estimated for multiple views of data. E.g sales
forecasting is done at the product level, brand level, company level, and
against the sales of some specific geospatial area.
• Semi-Supervised Territory Definition for Optimal Distribution
Shops coordinates are used to cluster them with the constraint of time in such
a way that the distributor can visit the maximum desired shops for distribution
in a given time frame.
• Data Pipelining & Semantic Refactoring of Code Base
To automate multidimensional sales analysis data pipelines are designed.

of web blogs and using ads to generate revenue. I wrote a ranking solution
to optimally route the web traffic to maximum revenue pages in accordance
with the source of traffic using features like CPM, RPM, and system custom
measures.
• Recommendation Engine for Instagram Influencers & Advertisers
Programmed a recommender system for a US-based startup to suggest the
best matching between Instagram influencers and advertisers in the context of
the advertisement. Instagram Business API is used with advertisement content
to do the recommendation.
• ChatBot for E‑commerce
A Chatbot is designed to answer e-commerce store-related queries. It was
majorly programmed using rule-based NLP techniques. To improve its
accuracy other machine learning models are also ensembled in this ChatBot
later on.

E‑commerce website is developed using the WordPress framework, and
custom plugins, and scripts are written to automate the tasks in the e‑
commerce store. For up‑gradation, a prototype of a future version is built using
the Python Django framework.
• E‑commerece Analytics & Automation
Python scripts are used on the backend to collect and analyze the data to
optimize the product shipment. Data is also used to calculate the
probability of fake orders. Later on, these stats are used to optimize
advisement campaigns on social media platforms.
• Automatic Mockups Generation & Image Optimization
Javascript scripts are used to automate the Mockups generation via
Photoshop actions. Batch processing is done in Photoshop for automation.
