Project3: COVID-19 Detection in Chest X-rays
Description: The dataset was collected through Kaggle. It contains almost
30k images which are splitted by 70:30 into train and test data, respectively.
The preprocessing of the image is done by resizing to 240x240, normalization
and histogram equalization is performed. The model is developed to train the
data using Deep Learning approaches which are CNN along with pre-trained
models RESNET-50, and VGG-16. The test accuracy of CNN, RESNET-50
and VGG-16 was 86.75%, 82.75%, and 84.25%.
Project4: Twitter Followers and Tweets Extraction Through Web Scraping
Description: I signed onto Twitter, navigated to the followers page, retrieved
their general information, and saved it to.csv files. Following that, I automate
my way to the homepage timeline and extract the tweets, the information of
the person who tweets it, the amount of likes, comments, and shares the post

Used a looping mechanism in the DataStage with runtime query changes. By
dynamically changing the query through the shell script, I ensured that the job
fetched data in smaller chunks, organized by month. This approach prevented
the insert statements from reaching the database threshold and enabled the
successful loading of historical data.

•Data Analytics Tech Refresh project- JAZZ 
Served as a  Data Engineer in data warehousing initiative involving the
migration of data warehouse from  TD to DB2W.
The primary challenge was dealing with large table sizes, making it impractical
to load all the data at once. To address this, we devised an efficient strategy,
creating monthly or yearly CSV files based on data volume and loading them
into the DB2 warehouse. We utilized shell scripting and Teradata Parallel
Transporter (TPT) to streamline the data migration, ensuring and maintaining
the data integrity.

Summary
An interest to comprehend how things work and the laws they follow
took me to pursue a career in physics, during my bachelors I came
across computer programming and was amazed by the technology
and the century of innovation that led us to the modern day picture of
automation, after I completed my bachelors in physics, I had to know
more about computers and so I did through online lectures, e-books,
lecture notes I took from my friends and before I knew it became a
passion and the excitement to run codes, understanding algorithms,
implementing them or just staring at the screen and being amazed
by all that was taking place inside a machine that only understood
binary language.
So, now if I got a chance to pursue a career in computer science, I'll
do it without a doubt and would love to embark on a journey that will
lead to a world running on algorithms.

Lead Machine Learning Engineer
November 2021 - Present  (2 years)
• Development of Geo‑Spatial Framework
Designed a geospatial framework in Python, in which we generalize common
operations like optimizing conversions between different CSRS, wrote custom
readers for different geo files, to introduce parallelism in processing geo data,
mapped sales data to maps to attach third-party attributes to sales entities
(products, customers, routes, areas) for introducing new dimensions to the
analysis.
• Predicting Stockouts and What Causing Them
An FMCG distributes tens of brands at thousands of shops in a single city. We
designed a system using processed sales data to predict shops getting out of
stock in combination with brands. We used our Statistical Sales Forecasting
engine to calculate the sellout rate of each brand at each
shop. Then designed a depletion strategy with a spilling mechanism to identify
the shops which will get out of stock in the future.
• Debugging Fluctuations in Sales
A system is programmed to find possible causes of sales fluctuations, e.g.,
sales of product X dropped in city Y. In this, we processed raw sales data
  Page 1 of 4   
using an internally crafted geospatial framework. Then we used this processed
data in a hierarchical way to find anomalies in different dimensions
E.g., sales fluctuation in time, in Socioeconomic classes (geo‑annotated), in
custom areas (provided by FMCG), or on the basis of other geo‑annotated
data available.
• Statistical Sales Forecasting
Sales are statistically estimated for multiple views of data. E.g sales
forecasting is done at the product level, brand level, company level, and
against the sales of some specific geospatial area.
• Semi-Supervised Territory Definition for Optimal Distribution
Shops coordinates are used to cluster them with the constraint of time in such
a way that the distributor can visit the maximum desired shops for distribution
in a given time frame.
• Data Pipelining & Semantic Refactoring of Code Base
To automate multidimensional sales analysis data pipelines are designed.

Worked for a US-based company that was handling a handsome number
of web blogs and using ads to generate revenue. I wrote a ranking solution
to optimally route the web traffic to maximum revenue pages in accordance
with the source of traffic using features like CPM, RPM, and system custom
measures.
• Recommendation Engine for Instagram Influencers & Advertisers
Programmed a recommender system for a US-based startup to suggest the
best matching between Instagram influencers and advertisers in the context of
the advertisement. Instagram Business API is used with advertisement content
to do the recommendation.
• ChatBot for E‑commerce
A Chatbot is designed to answer e-commerce store-related queries. It was
majorly programmed using rule-based NLP techniques. To improve its
accuracy other machine learning models are also ensembled in this ChatBot
later on.

Programmed automated scrapping engines for famous news and e‑commerce
websites for data collection. Used scrappy & selenium frameworks for
scrapping.
• Skin Pathologies & Carcinoma Calssification
This was a project related to the classification of skin pathologies using deep
learning models. I trained the model on the DermNet dataset. Handled
the imbalance nature of multiple classes in data. Trained and fine-tuned it on
multiple famous models.

• Web Development of E‑commerce Store
E‑commerce website is developed using the WordPress framework, and
custom plugins, and scripts are written to automate the tasks in the e‑
commerce store. For up‑gradation, a prototype of a future version is built using
the Python Django framework.
• E‑commerece Analytics & Automation
Python scripts are used on the backend to collect and analyze the data to
optimize the product shipment. Data is also used to calculate the
probability of fake orders. Later on, these stats are used to optimize
advisement campaigns on social media platforms.
• Automatic Mockups Generation & Image Optimization
Javascript scripts are used to automate the Mockups generation via
Photoshop actions. Batch processing is done in Photoshop for automation.
Python scripts are used to automate the production of optimal-size images for
the e‑commerce platform
